# ANN-Mathematically

This notebook provides a comprehensive explanation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) from a mathematical perspective. It covers:

1. Structure of ANNs: Nodes, layers, and connections.
2. Mathematical Foundations:
      + Forward propagation
      + Activation functions
      + Loss calculation
      + Backpropagation and gradient descent
3. Practical Implementation: Step-by-step demonstration of building an ANN model with calculations.
4. Visualization: Includes plots and diagrams to aid understanding.

## Objective
To help readers understand the theoretical and practical aspects of ANNs using a mathematical approach. Ideal for students, researchers, and developers aiming to deepen their knowledge of neural networks.

### How to Use
